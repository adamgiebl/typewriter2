      <p class="typewritten">
        A typewriter is a mechanical or electromechanical machine for typing
        characters similar to those produced by a printer's movable type.<br />
        Typically, a typewriter has an array of keys, and each one causes a
        different single character to be produced on the paper, by means <br />
        of a ribbon with dried ink struck against the paper by a type element
        similar to the sorts used in movable type letterpress printing.<br />
      </p>
      <p class="typewritten">
        On some typewriters, a separate type element (called a typebar)
        corresponds to each key; others use a single type<br />
        element (such as a typeball or disc) with a different portion of it used
        for each character. At the end of the nineteenth<br />
        century, the term typewriter was also applied to a person who used a
        typing machine.
